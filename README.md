ATM Simulator System
Overview
The ATM Simulator System is a console-based application designed to emulate the functionality of an automated teller machine (ATM). Built using C++, this project demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and RDBMS integration. The system provides a seamless user experience for managing basic banking operations such as balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, and transaction histories.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login with account credentials.
Account Management:
Check account balance.
Deposit and withdraw funds.
View transaction history.
Admin Controls:
Add, delete, or manage user accounts (optional).
Data Persistence: Transactions and account data are stored using a relational database, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: C++
Database: SQLite/MySQL (or any other RDBMS)
Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Exception handling for robust error management
File handling or database queries for data persistence
Usage
This project is a practical implementation of core programming and database concepts, suitable for:

Demonstrating RDBMS and OOP concepts in academic evaluations.
Learning real-world applications of data structures, file I/O, and database queries.
How to Run
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio).
Set up the database connection (if applicable) by configuring the database credentials in the code.
Compile and execute the program.
Future Enhancements
Integration with a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user experience.
Support for additional banking features like fund transfers and account statements.
Enhanced security with encryption for sensitive data.
